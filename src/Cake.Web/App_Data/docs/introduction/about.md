This user guide, like Cake itself, is under very active development. Some parts of Cake aren't 
documented as completely as they need to be, but we glady accept your contributions.

We need your help to improve the documentation for Cake, so if there is something that you 
would like to add then you can edit the content directly on GitHub.
