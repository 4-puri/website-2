As 2016 is just about to be fully baked, the year has been packed with many ingredients, with this post we would like to take the opportunity to reflect on a few of the essences of what's been a truly amazing and eventful Cake year.

### Community

First of all we must highlight and send a big THANK YOU to the amazing community that has formed around Cake!  

Over a hundred individual contributors to the Cake projects, helping out with documentation, adding new features, raising issues and fixing bugs. Over a quarter of a million downloads of the main Cake NuGet package! Together with you we during 2016 released no less than fifteen releases!

As maintainers of an open source project it's both amazing and humbling so see how people are getting a taste for your project and going out speaking, blogging, tweeting and helping out fellow bakers on the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/cake-build/cake), [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cakebuild), forums and social media.

### Debugging support

In May we added support for debugging your Cake scripts with [Visual Studio](http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/05/debug-cake-file), enabling you things like stepping thru code, set break points and watch variables. In September we added debugging with [VSCode](http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/09/debug-cake-vscode).

### .NET Foundation

One of the bigger announcements 2016, was in June when Gary at [NDC Oslo](https://vimeo.com/171704581) announced that [Cake joins the .NET foundation](http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/06/cake-joins-dotnetfoundation). Joining the foundation assures the longevity of the Cake project, ensures it's here to stay and has the resources to do so.

### Cake Contribution Organization

In August we launched the [Cake Contribution Organization](http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/08/cake-contribution-organization) to ensure that any addins and modules that are created, can continue to be maintained, should the original developer no longer be in a position to maintain it. It's been very well received and there's now almost a hundred [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/cake-contrib) packages that has adopted the organization and twenty-six projects that have chosen to move their repositories to the organization.

### .NET Core support

Cake was early to support the .NET Core tooling, but in September we announced [Cake v0.16.0 released](http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/09/cake-v0-16-0-released), with this release finally Cake itself was able to run cross platform on .NET Core. This was the largest refactoring we've ever done and it was a great feeling to get that out the door!

### The Team

In December we added an additional member to the team, [Alistair Chapman](https://github.com/orgs/cake-build/people/agc93), he's been an amazing asset, contributing directly to Cake, surrounding tooling and in supporting the community. Just to name a few things he's mastermind behind the [Cake for Visual Studio extension](http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/09/cake-for-visual-studio) and [Cake for Yeoman](http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/09/cake-for-yeoman).

### In the spotlight

2016 certainly feels like the year awareness of the project exponentially increased, Cake core team members appeared on no less than six [podcasts](http://cakebuild.net/docs/resources/podcasts), a number of conference [presentations](http://cakebuild.net/docs/resources/presentations), articles in the [news](http://cakebuild.net/docs/resources/in-the-news) and [blog posts](http://cakebuild.net/docs/resources/blogs).
It's truly amazing and humbling feeling that so many has found and appreciate the project.

### Closing words

Yet again a big thanks do all that have contributed to Cake, 2016 has been a great journey and we're really looking forward to what 2017 will bring!

The Cake Team thanks you for 2016 and wishes you Happy New Year!
