Version 0.5.5 of Cake has been released.

New in this release (except all awesome new features and improvements)
is the  [Cake.Testing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Testing)
NuGet package that contains fakes for interfaces like
[IFileSystem](api://T:Cake.Core.IO.IFileSystem) and
[ICakeEnvironment](api://T:Cake.Core.ICakeEnvironment). We believe
that this NuGet package will make testing of your Cake addins
much easier.

* Added alias to retrieve [all environment variables](api://M:Cake.Common.EnvironmentAliases.EnvironmentVariables(Cake.Core.ICakeContext)).
