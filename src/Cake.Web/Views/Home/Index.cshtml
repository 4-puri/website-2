        <h1>What is Cake?</h1>
        <p>Cake (C# Make) is a build automation system with a C# DSL to do things like compiling code, copy files/folders, running unit tests, compress files and build NuGet packages.</p>

            <h3 class="align-top">Reliable</h3>
            <p>
                Regardless if you're building on your own machine, or building on a CI system such as AppVeyor,
                TeamCity, TFS or Jenkins, Cake is built to behave in the same way.
            </p>

            <h3>Familiar</h3>
            <p>
                Cake is built on top of the Roslyn compiler which enables you to write your build scripts in C#.
            </p>

            <h3>Batteries included</h3>
            <p>
                Cake supports the most common tools used during builds such as MSBuild, MSTest, xUnit, NUnit,
                NuGet, ILMerge, WiX and SignTool out of the box.
            </p>

            <h3>Flexible</h3>
            <p>
                Do you need support for a new functionality? Easy! Cake comes with various extensibility
                points to make it easy to plug in your own functionality.
            </p>

            <h3>Open source</h3>
            <p>
                We believe in open source and so should you. The source code for Cake is <a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake">hosted on GitHub</a> and includes everything needed to build it yourself.
