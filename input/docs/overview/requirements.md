# .NET Core 2.1

Cake provides two options for running on [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), cross-platform on Windows, Mac or Linux.

The [Cake.CoreCLR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.CoreCLR) NuGet package, targeting `netcoreapp2.0`.

The [Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool) NuGet package, a .NET Core global tool targeting `netcoreapp2.1`.


# .NET Framework 4.6.1

The [Cake](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake) NuGet package can be used on Windows to run using the full [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461) or newer.

Alternatively, you can also use [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) to run on Mac or Linux. The official minimum recommended version of Mono is `5.12.0`.

**NOTE:** It is suggested to use [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework/net472) or newer to run build scripts which are using addins targeting .NET Standard 2.0 only.
