Version 0.19.1 of Cake has been released.

This is a minor hotfix release for 0.19.0, fixes an issue discovered in the new VSWhere aliases.

So what is VSWhere? One issue with Visual Studio 2017 is that it can be installed anywhere and you can have multiple versions side by side, which results in that the registry keys and standard paths previously used to identify where Visual Studio was installed no longer apply.

This is where VSWhere comes in, it's a utility that can identify and list current installations of Visual Studio and other developer products installed.

VSWhere is available on NuGet (and Chocolatey) which means you can fetch it using the tool pre-processor directive like this:

```csharp
#tool nuget:?package=vswhere
```
There's a couple of [VSWhere aliases](http://cakebuild.net/dsl/vswhere/) available in Cake, if you just want to use the latest Visual Studio version available - then there's the [VSWhereLatest](http://cakebuild.net/api/Cake.Common.Tools.VSWhere/VSWhereAliases/59EB3043) alias. A complete example of fetching the VSWhere tool and using it to find path to MSBuild below:

```csharp
#tool nuget:?package=vswhere
DirectoryPath vsLatest  = VSWhereLatest();
FilePath msBuildPathX64 = (vsLatest==null)
                            ? null
                            : vsLatest.CombineWithFilePath("./MSBuild/15.0/Bin/amd64/MSBuild.exe");

MSBuild("./src/Example.sln", new MSBuildSettings {
    ToolPath = msBuildPathX64
    });

```
